#This is a simple virtual version of the puzzle "Game 15", created with Python, using Tkinter.
#The game randomly scrambles 15 tiles with numbers in a 4x4 grid, with one empty space. 
#The player clicks the tiles to move them into the empty space, while trying to arrange the numbers in order from 1 to 15 (lowest to highest). 
#The program checks if the player won and displays a victory message when the puzzle is solved.
