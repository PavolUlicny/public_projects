#This is a simple version of the Tower of Hanoi game made with Python, using Tkinter.
#At the start, the player chooses a difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.
#The number of disks depends on the difficulty selected.
#The goal is to move all the disks from the first tower to the third one.
#You can only move one disk at a time, and you can't place a bigger disk on a smaller one.
#The player moves the disks by clicking on the towers.
#If all the disks are stacked correctly on the third tower, the game shows a "You win!" message.
